# Blog-API

Created a RESTful API to interact with the frontend React App. Build precise API endpoints and sent json responses to the client efficiently. Sent proper error status codes and messages on bad requests.
Handled User authentication using the jsonwebtoken library.

Stored the token in the client allowing user to connect to the backend server efficiently. Fetched data from the API on app mounting. Made use of various React concepts including hooks and Outlets as well as the React Router for client side routing.


Implemented logic allowing the user to register and login as an AUTHOR or a USER. Authors are able to CRUD blog posts and CRUD comments. Users are able to view blog posts and CRUD comments on posts.

Implemented all database queries using Prisma.

Conducted comprehensive integration tests on all routes, controllers, and database operations using Supertest and Jest to ensure optimal application performance and reliability.
